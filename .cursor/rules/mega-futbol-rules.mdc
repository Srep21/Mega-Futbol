1. User Experience
Users land on the game URL and start playing instantly — no waiting screens.

The game loads fullscreen or centered on the page with minimal distractions.

A minimal header shows the game logo/name and optionally a “How to Play” tooltip/modal.

Matchmaking pairs users immediately with the first available opponent (FIFO queue).

If no opponent is found within a set timeout, user may wait or play against a simple AI bot.

After each match, users see a win/lose screen with a “Play Again” button and optional signup prompt.

Signup is optional and collects email + username for saving stats and updates.

2. Core Gameplay
Side-view, 1v1 soccer game with big-headed characters (Sports Heads style).

Controls: arrow keys for movement, plus jump and kick buttons.

Matches have a timer and a visible scoreboard.

Simple sound effects and animations enhance gameplay feedback.

3. Matchmaking
Simple FIFO queue without skill-based matching.

Immediate pairing with first available player or fallback AI bot if none available.

4. User Accounts (Future-ready)
Guest mode enabled; no signup required to play.

Signup modal offered after matches or via header button.

Registered accounts save match stats (wins, losses).

Email integration supports newsletters and game updates.

5. UI Elements
Minimal header with logo and signup button.

Popup signup form for email + username.

Post-match results screen with replay option and signup prompt.

6. Tech Stack Overview
Frontend: Phaser.js or PixiJS for rendering; Vanilla JS or React for UI; Socket.IO or Colyseus for WebSocket multiplayer.

Backend: Node.js server with WebSocket support; matchmaking queue in memory or Redis; server-authoritative game loop.

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for accounts and stats; Redis for session cache and matchmaking queue.

7. Development Milestones
Phase 1: Build local 1v1 gameplay or simple bot fallback; basic UI with “Play Now.”

Phase 2: Add online multiplayer matchmaking via WebSocket; server sync logic; scoreboard and timer.

Phase 3: Add signup popup; develop smarter AI bot; save stats; setup email campaigns.

Phase 4: Polish UI for mobile; add sounds, animations, cosmetics; improve anti-cheat.

8. Additional Guidelines
Keep onboarding simple; no forced signup before play.

Matchmaking is purely FIFO; no skill tiers.

Email signup strictly opt-in and after gameplay.

Optimize for fast game start (<10 seconds from URL load).

Prioritize multiplayer smoothness over graphic complexity.
