## **Branch Strategy**

- **Main Branch**: Always stable, deployable code
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/player-movement`, `feature/ball-physics`, etc.
- **Integration Branches**: `integration/phase1`, `integration/phase2` for combining features

## **Work Distribution**

**Developer 1**: Frontend game mechanics (Features 2, 3, 4, 5, 14, 15)
**Developer 2**: Backend systems (Features 6, 7, 8, 9, 16)
**Both**: Features 1, 10, 11, 12, 13 (collaborative features)

## **Progress Tracking**

- [ ] = Not started
- [X] = Completed
- [~] = In progress
- [!] = Blocked/Issues

---

## **Notes**
- Each feature should be developed in its own branch
- Test features independently before merging
- Use integration branches to combine features before main
- Update checkboxes as features are completed
